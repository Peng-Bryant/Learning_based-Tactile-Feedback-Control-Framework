# Learning_based-Tactile-Feedback-Control-Framework
Generalizable and robust learning-based tactile feedback control framework.In our research, we propose a two-stage tactile feedback control framework that relies on only a small amount of paired data to achieve sim-to-real transfer and exhibit enhanced adaptability to the physical environment.
