# Generalizable and Robust Learning-Based Tactile Feedback Control Framework

## Abstract

Tactile signals play a crucial role in introducing localized information for enhancing the dexterity of robots. This project proposes a two-stage tactile feedback control framework that relies on a small amount of paired data to achieve sim-to-real transfer and enhanced adaptability to the physical environment. The first stage leverages unlabeled tactile images to learn distinctive features, while the second stage employs privileged learning to adapt to different physical parameters based on historical information. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated in adapting to robotic arm-tactile sensor systems and performing push and surface-following tasks under varying conditions.

## Overview

Modern robotic systems benefit greatly from the integration of tactile sensors, enabling them to perform complex tasks that require fine motor skills, such as pushing and surface-following. Optical tactile sensors like Tactip have demonstrated their utility across a spectrum of applications. In this research endeavor, we introduce a novel framework that capitalizes on the power of machine learning and feedback control to enhance the performance and robustness of tactile-equipped robots.

## Key Features

1. **Learning from Unlabeled Data**: The first stage of our framework harnesses the potential of unsupervised learning using thousands of unlabeled tactile images. Through this, the system acquires a deep understanding of the distinctive features across various tactile sensors.

2. **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Building upon the learned features, the framework adeptly performs sim-to-real transfer, utilizing only a limited amount of paired data. This innovation bridges the gap between simulation environments and real-world scenarios, ensuring consistent performance across different contexts.

3. **Adaptation through Privileged Learning**: The second stage of our framework employs privileged learning, enabling the system to deduce and adapt to varying physical parameters based on historical data. This adaptive capability contributes to the framework's remarkable adaptability in changing conditions.

## Results and Impact

Our research yields promising results that showcase the effectiveness of our proposed framework in enhancing the interaction between robotic arm-tactile sensor systems. The system's ability to perform precision tasks, such as push and surface-following, is underscored by its remarkable adaptability across a diverse range of physical parameter settings.

## Future Applications

By integrating tactile feedback into the core operations of robotic systems, our approach holds significant promise for addressing real-world challenges in various domains. The framework's increased adaptability and robustness make it an attractive solution for applications that demand precise and reliable robotic interactions in ever-changing environments.
